Have you ever dealt with a large folder of spreadsheets that you need to combine into one?

With spreadsheets, you have to copy and paste over and over again.

But with R, you can script that process.

In fact, I've created a function for you that simplifies the process.

You have to download my **muckrakr** package off of GitHub with the **devtools** package.


```{r install_muckrakr, warning=F, message=F}
# If you don't have devtools installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("andrewbtran/muckrakr")
library(muckrakr)
```

### Bulk CSV files

The function we want to use is called `bulk_csv()`.

It looks like this (**Don't run this command, it's theoretical**):

```{r example, eval=F}
bulk_csv(folder = "DEFAULTBULKCSV2017", export = "filenamedefaultbulkcsv2018.csv"")
```

Two arguments: 

* folder - The folder in relation to your working directory where the csv files exist. Default folder is the current working directory.
* export - File name to export csv file as, if wanted.

Alright, so within this project folder is a sub folder full of CSVs. 

![](/importing_exporting/folder_of_files/images/csvs.png?classes=shadow)

It's in `data/csvs`


{{% notice note %}}
This package is based on readr, so passing on variables from read_csv will work in bulk_csv. These variables will apply to the import of each CSV sheet.
{{% /notice %}}

To create a new dataframe with all the data sets combined, the command would be:

```{r bulk_csv, warning=F, message=F}
combined_data <- bulk_csv(folder="data/csvs")
```

To simply export the data as a new combined CSV file, the command would be:

```{r bulk_csv2, warning=F, message=F}
bulk_csv(folder="data/csvs", export="combined_data.csv")
```


This would save the file to the current working directory.

You can specify the location to download in export as long as you put the folder structure before the CSV file name, like:

```{r bulk_csv3, warning=F, message=F}
bulk_csv(folder="data/csvs", export="data/data_export/combined_data.csv")
```

### Bulk Excel files

Same concept as above, but the function name is `bulk_excel()`.

Read more about the [function](https://andrewbtran.github.io/muckrakr/bulk_excel.html) on the [**muckrakr** github repo](https://github.com/andrewbtran/muckrakr).
