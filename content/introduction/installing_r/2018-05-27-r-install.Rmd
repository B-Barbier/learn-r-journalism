## Downloading R

* R homepage - [http://www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org)
* CRAN Mirrors - [http://cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org)

You can also install [via command line](http://tristanpenman.com/blog/posts/2015/10/20/installing-r-and-rstudio-on-mac-os-x/) package manager Homebrew.

## Default R Console

This is what the default R app looks like.

It's very simple but things have advanced to the point that we don't need to settle for this.

Now that we have the basic code installed, we can move on to a much [better interface](../../installing_rstudio/installing-rstudio/) for working with R.
