# Importing CSV files

- Importing CSV is part of base R, no package needed
- But we're going to use a package anyway, readr

# Two ways to get data

- If you have the URL address
- If you have the file on your computer

## Get the URL

Right click [the link](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Admissions-to-DMHAS-Addiction-Treatment-by-Town-Ye/iyru-82zq/data) of the data and click **Copy Link Address**

![](/importing_exporting/csv/images/rightclick.png?classes=shadow)

## read.csv()

The function is `read.csv()` and put the URL address in "" and add the `stringsAsFactors=F`
```{r segment1}
df_csv <- read.csv("https://data.ct.gov/api/views/iyru-82zq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", stringsAsFactors=F)
```

## stringsAsFactors=F

Why? 

Blame statisticians.

Back when R was created the users weren't using it as we use it now, with all these different strings.

## The other way to import the data: Download it

When you right click on the link, instead of clicking **Copy Link Address**-- this time, click **Save Link As...**

Save to the directory you're working in

After saving to the directory, click on the circle arrow on the right to refresh the files to make sure it's there.

![](/importing_exporting/csv/images/directory.png?classes=shadow)

# Note: How to change directories in RStudio

Either by typing `setwd("/directory/where/you/want")` or by clicking in the menu up top **Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory...**

![](/importing_exporting/csv/images/setwd.png?classes=shadow)

# Importing local csv data

Just like before, except instead of the URL, it's the name of the file.

**Note:** This will only work if the working directory is set to where the csv file is.
```{r segment2}
df_csv <- read.csv("data/Admissions_to_DMHAS_Addiction_Treatment_by_Town__Year__and_Month.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
```
