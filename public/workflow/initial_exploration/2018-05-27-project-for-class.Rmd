A couple options for this class.
We're going to  operate out of one folder.

So you can create a folder now.

Or download the files from HERE.

Ideally, you'll create the files yourself in the correct folder structure. THen you'll type the code in yourself manually.

This is the best way to learn and train yourself by doing this process manually.

That being said, if you get stuck, all the scripts and code and proper folder structure is available to download. But try to use it as a reference and avoid copying and pasting the code because you're passively learning.
